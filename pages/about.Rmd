This database contains wordlists collected as part of the [Daghestanian loans](https://ilcl.hse.ru/en/projects) project by the [Linguistic Convergence Laboratory](https://ilcl.hse.ru/en/) at NRU HSE. The aim of the 160-item shortlist, which is based on the [World Loanword Database questionnaire](https://wold.clld.org/), is to measure lexical contact on a micro-level. In other words, to quantify lexical convergence among the speech communities of minority languages on a village-level, and to detect fine-grained areal patterns beyond general observations on the spheres of influence of certain languages.
