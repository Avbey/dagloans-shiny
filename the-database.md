## The database

For now, the table shows source **Concepts** and target **Words**. Each target word is grouped in a similarity **Set** - a set of words that have the same meaning and look similar. In the future, data will be added on borrowing sources. Metadata includes the name of the **Village** where the word was recorded, the administrative **District** it is part of, the **Language** spoken there, and the **List ID**: these ID's correspond to a particular speaker or in some cases a written source like a dictionary. Data is accessible at: [Github/LingConLab/DagloanDatabase](https://github.com/LingConLab/DagloanDatabase).
<br>
The dataset in the dummy format is available [here](https://github.com/LingConLab/Dagloan_database/blob/master/Convert/words_28032019_dummy.tsv).
